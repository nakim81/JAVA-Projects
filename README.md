# JAVA-Projects
Projects I have done to study and understand JAVA
1) 2048: Implemented an algorithm to efficiently manage the game status by manipulating a 2D array that takes account of all edge cases
2) BYOW: Implemented an open world game where the player explores through randomly generated maps based on a user inputted seedvalue to find special objects and collect all coins
3) Deques: Constructed both singly linked-list and circular doubly linked-list data structure classes from scratch using custom node objects that contain data and a pointer to theconnected nodes
4) WordNet: Built a program to calculate search frequencies of words entered by a user within a specified time period. Words searched byusers were also compared to the total search frequencies found in the database
